  It all started when found Worm after browsing to the HFY story
  <%= cp.tab_link("https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/", content: "The Last Angel") %> from reddit.
  After reading that amazing story I somehow found my way to
  <%= cp.tab_link("https://parahumans.wordpress.com/", content: "Worm") %>.
  Things escalated quickly from there... and a year later there were no more unread stories across fanfiction.net, spacebattles, and sufficientvelocity.
  That is when I started following all the new and updating stories on each of the sites much more closely.
<% end %>

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  I often thought about writing my own story, I actually got around to completely outlining one that was similar, but darker in tone then
  <%= cp.tab_link("https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/messages-from-an-angel-worm.31268/threadmarks", content: "Messages from an Angel") %>.
  This was before it and many of the additional friendbringer fics came out.
  Since my

    writing and (especially) grammer
  <% end %>skills are well below average, I basically decided that my stories would never become reality.
  I went back to just reading and following anything that popped up on the front page of each site.

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  This is where the primary motivation for creating this site came into play.
  I found it very frustrating to try and stay up to date with all the activity.
  Each of the sites seemed to be lacking in several search, filter, and follow features that I wanted.
  For example, find all the recently created and updated stories for the week sorted by popularity.
  This came to a head one friday evening and I spent the weekend writing a command line site crawler to pull all the recently threadmarked stories for spacebattles.
  I continued to tweak the script for a few weeks, before I got annoyed that I had to keep copy/pasting the links into my browser.
<% end %>

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  At the start of the week this site went live, I decided to write the much needed frontend to the script during my off hours from work, so that I could finally filter, sort, and open each story in my browser.
  Several sleepless nights later, one domain registration, a single Amazon Web Service instance (what a trooper), and here we are.
<% end %>

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  While I did make this site for myself, I also consider it my way of giving back to the great wormverse community.
  It will stay up for at least as long as I am still actively reading the stories.

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  <%= cp.b_tag(content: "Word of caution") %>, I enjoy tinkering with cutting edge web technologies and use this site as a testing ground to see how they operate and scale.
  This will cause errors, downtime, or broken functionality for the site when things do not go as planned.
  For example, I will soon be messing around with the filtering and sorting options.
  You will likely see several filters moved into a dropdown, freeing up space in the table and a cleaner mobile experience.
