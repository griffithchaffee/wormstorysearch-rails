  It all started after browsing to
  <%= cp.tab_link("https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/", content: "The Last Angel") %> from the HFY subreddit.
  After reading that amazing story I somehow found my way to
  <%= cp.tab_link("https://parahumans.wordpress.com/", content: "Worm") %>.
  Things escalated... and a year later there was no fanfic left unread on fanfiction.net, spacebattles, and sufficientvelocity.

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  All I could do that point was follow new and updated stories.
  However, I found it very frustrating to try and stay up to date with all the activity.
  Each of the sites seemed to be lacking in several search, filter, and follow features that I wanted.
  For example, find all the recently created and updated stories in the past 48 hours sorted by popularity.
  This came to a head one friday evening and I spent the weekend writing a command line site crawler to pull all the recently threadmarked stories on spacebattles.
  I continued to tweak the script over a few more weeks and eventually it work well enough.
  This satisfied me for a time, but having to copy and paste links from the output into my browser got tedious and there was no mobile access.
<% end %>

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  I decided to write the much needed frontend to the script during my off hours from work, so that I could finally filter, sort, and open each story in my browser.
  Several sleepless nights later, one domain registration, a single Amazon Web server (what a trooper), and here we are.

  While I did make this site for myself, I also consider it my way of giving back to the awesome wormverse community.
  It will stay up for at least as long as I am still active in the community.

<%= cp.p_tag do %>
  <%= cp.b_tag(content: "Word of caution") %>, I enjoy tinkering with cutting edge web technologies and use this site as a testing ground to see how they operate and scale.
  This will cause occasional errors, downtime, or broken functionality for the site when things do not go as planned.
